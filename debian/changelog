xview (3.2p1.4-24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compile with -D_GNU_SOURCE for glibc 2.9 compatibility in regex.h.
    Closes: #544252
  * Added Recommends: xviewg-dev, xutils-dev to xview-examples since the
    example sources need the header files from these packages for
    compilation.
  * Moved /etc/X11/xview/textswrc to /usr/share/doc/xviewg/examples/textswrc
    since it's never read there by XView and servers only as an example
    for copying into ~/.textswrc

  * new upstream version: 
    Patchlevel 3 adds the TrueColor-patches for ol(v)wm, fixes the
    buffer-overrun problem with cmdtool (that caused cmdtool's output to
